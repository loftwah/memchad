With its unique features and playful ASCII art, Memchad is more than just a caching solution‚Äîit's a statement.

## Features

- **Port 42069**: A memorable port for a memorable project.
- **ASCII Art and Fun**: Includes a custom welcome message with ASCII art, powered by `figlet`.
- **Easy Integration**: Works just like `memcached`, with an added twist of personality.
